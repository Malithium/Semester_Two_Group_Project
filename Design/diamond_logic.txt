Check collision between all cubes and diamond FIRST. 
If true then follow the logic below, else don't move.

if(pos.x >= diamond.x - 2 && pos.x <= diamond.x)
	diamond.x = player.x + 2;
	setPos(diamond);

else if(pos.x <= diamond.x + 2 && pos.x >= diamond.x)
	diamond.x = player.x - 2;
	setPos(diamond);

if(pos.z >= diamond.z - 2 && pos.z <= diamond.z)
	diamond.z = player.z + 2;
	setPos(diamond);

else if(pos.z <= diamond.z + 2 && pos.z >= diamond.z)
	diamond.z = player.z - 2;
	setPos(diamond);



## Notes:

-  Camera player moved from assets into GameAssetManager and passed into draw
    method.
-  New method in diamond asset to get their pos.
-  AI must occur before DRAW and after COLLISION
-  Move draw below EVENTS WHILE loop, in main level loop
