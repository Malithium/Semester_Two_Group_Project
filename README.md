# *Semester Two Group Project*

A simple 3D platformer where you collect collectables to finish the level. 

It will feature two levels, to begin with, and hopefully time won't constrain us from expanding it beyond this small design. You will run around collecting diamonds, which will try and avoid the player using A* path-finding, however we will be using OpenGL to load in blocks of cubes to create interactive levels.

We will try to post new information after ever commit.
